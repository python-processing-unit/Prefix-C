# Contributing to Prefix

We welcome bug reports, feature requests (within reason), documentation improvements, tests, and code patches. This document explains how to contribute and the licensing terms that apply to contributions.

## TL;DR

- Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
- For code changes, open a pull request (PR) from a branch or fork.
- By contributing (issues, PRs, commits, patches, or other submissions) you agree to release your contributions under the Unlicense, dedicating them to the public domain. See "License for contributions" below.

## File of record

This repository is licensed under the Unlicense. See the repository `UNLICENSE` file for the full text:
https://unlicense.org/

## License for contributions (IMPORTANT)

By submitting any contribution to this repository (including commits, pull requests, issues with code/text, or other content), you confirm and agree that:

- You are the copyright owner of that contribution (or are authorized to submit it).
- You irrevocably dedicate and release your contribution under the Unlicense, placing it into the public domain worldwide to the fullest extent permitted by law.
- You grant the project maintainers and the public the right to use, copy, modify, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of your contribution without restriction and without requiring attribution.
- If you cannot agree to these terms, do not submit contributions to this repository.

## How to contribute

1. Search Issues
   - Check existing issues to see whether your bug or feature request already exists. If it does, add relevant information or a comment.

2. Open an Issue
   - If no issue exists, create one. Provide a clear title, a concise description of the problem or proposal, steps to reproduce (for bugs), and any relevant environment information.

3. Make a Change
   - Fork the repository (or create a branch in a branch-per-feature workflow if you have push rights).
   - Create a branch named meaningfully, e.g., `fix/typo-xyz`, `feat/prefix-parser`, or `test/add-instruction-tests`.
   - Implement your change. Keep commits focused and atomic.

4. Tests and Quality
   - Add tests for bug fixes and features where applicable.
   - Make sure existing tests pass.
   - Run linters and formatters used by the project (if none are mandated, follow existing code style).

5. Commit Messages
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Include the rationale if the change is non-obvious.

6. Open a Pull Request
   - Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against this repository's main branch (or other branch named in the repo workflow).
   - Describe what you changed and why. Link related issues with `#issue-number`.
   - If your PR includes substantial changes, list the testing steps you used.

7. Review Process
   - Maintainers will review PRs and may request changes. Please respond to feedback in a timely manner.
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge. You may be asked to rebase or squash commits before merge.

## Non-code contributions

- Documentation fixes, examples, and small editorial changes can often be merged quickly.
- For larger documentation efforts, open an issue first to discuss scope.

## Code style

- For Python code, follow PEP 8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- For Prefix code, NO USING TABS FOR INDENTS!

## Security

- Do not submit secrets, credentials, or other sensitive data.
- If you discover a major security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers rather than opening a public issue.
- Minor security vulnerabilities (e.g. errors in the standard library) should be reported through a public issue.

## Contact / Questions

- If you’re unsure where to start, open an issue with a brief outline and ask for guidance.
- For legal or licensing questions, open an issue and tag the maintainers.
